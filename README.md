# Beto Bar

by Alex

## Feature List

This app is for a home bar. It will be a NextJS web app that is styled with Tailwinds. The website has three main components.

1. A list of the different liquors, mixers, garnishes, and bitters that the home has.
2. I recipe book that a guest can scroll through to make a choice of cocktail the host will prepare.
3. A _sign in book_ page. A guest can enter a form that included there name, what drink they had, a 0 to 5 star rating and a comment. The page should have a way to see all the past sign ins.
